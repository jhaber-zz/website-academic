I'm a computational social scientist, project and community leader, and award-winning educator. I'm passionate about helping others and creating positive social impact through rigorous, reproducible research that influences policy.

My research applies computational methods to study how organizational contexts shape the impacts of structural inequalities. I analyze the ways organizational cultures, identities, and structures mediate and reinforce societal inequalities in locally embedded ways. 

As someone dedicated to data science community and education, I am now a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Massive Data Institute (MDI) at Georgetown University. My goal at MDI is to foster research communities while applying data science methods to policy puzzles. I also co-coordinated the D-Lab's [Computational Text Analysis Working Group](http://dlabctawg.github.io/) and the [Text Across Domains (TextXD) symposium](https://www.textxd.org/) at UC Berkeley. Finally, I organized the virtual [Summer Institute for Computational Social Science in the San Francisco Bay Area (BAY-SICSS)](http://bit.ly/baysicss) in 2020, which created partnerships between computational social scientists and Bay Area nonprofits.
