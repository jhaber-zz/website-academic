I’m an computational social scientist and data scientist experienced in project leadership from conception & capacity-building to delivery. I’m skilled in natural language processing, machine learning, statistical techniques; presenting results to diverse stakeholders; and teaching data science. I specialize in leading research into digital information flows, inequality, and policy. I’m committed to positive social impact through collaboration, rigorous research, and open-access code and workflows.

As someone dedicated to data science community and education, I also co-coordinated the D-Lab's [Computational Text Analysis Working Group](http://dlabctawg.github.io/) and the [Text Across Domains (TextXD) symposium](https://www.textxd.org/) at UC Berkeley. Finally, I organized the virtual [Summer Institute for Computational Social Science in the San Francisco Bay Area (BAY-SICSS)](http://bit.ly/baysicss) in 2020, which created partnerships between computational social scientists and Bay Area nonprofits.
