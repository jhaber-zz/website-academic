In accordance with the core values of reproducibility, transparency, and open access, solving my own domain-specific puzzles has led me to develop a complex, open-source project infrastructure portable to other computational social science applications. As project manager of a total of nearly 40 coders through the Undergraduate Research Apprentice and Data Science Discovery Programs, I’ve developed a multi-platform, reproducible approach to coordinating several coding teams (e.g., text analysis, web-scraping, and data management) using GitHub, Slack, BaseCamp, and Box. Indeed, my team and I have created solutions to a range of pressing challenges faced by many computational social scientists, from corpus creation and distributed web-crawling to Docker and virtual machine environment management. I’ve publicly shared these tools through GitHub and public documentation, and one of my team’s goals is to distribute them as Docker images. 

For documentation on virtual machine management, web-crawling, and more, see the project documentation at https://tinyurl.com/cloud-VMs-crawling. For current code, see the GitHub pages for myself (https://github.com/jhaber-zz/) and the research team I supervise (https://github.com/URAP-charter/). For a public pre-registration with the Open Science Foundation, see https://osf.io/zgh5u/register/565fb3678c5e4a66b5582f67.
