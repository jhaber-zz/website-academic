In accordance with the core values of reproducibility, transparency, and open access, solving my own domain-specific puzzles has led me to develop a complex, open-source project infrastructure portable to other computational social science applications. As project manager of a total of nearly 40 coders through the Undergraduate Research Apprentice and Data Science Discovery Programs, I’ve developed a multi-platform, reproducible approach to coordinating several coding teams (e.g., text analysis, web-scraping, and data management) using GitHub, Slack, BaseCamp, and Box. Indeed, my team and I have created solutions to a range of pressing challenges faced by many computational social scientists, from corpus creation and distributed web-crawling to Docker and virtual machine environment management. I’ve publicly shared these tools through GitHub and public documentation, and I encourage you to take and adapt them to your use case. 

For guidance on virtual machine management, web-crawling, and more, see [the project documentation.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fCG4At19jlcmPOgvQWkv-J-wJNNyqwXOVPN-9EAwzBk/edit?usp=sharing) For current code, see the GitHub pages [for myself](https://github.com/jhaber-zz/) and [for the research team I supervise.](https://github.com/URAP-charter/) To reproduce the results of my paper on charter school identities submitted to Sociology of Education (Sorting Schools), you can [access the code](https://github.com/URAP-charter/sorting-schools-2019). You can also read [the public pre-registration with the Open Science Foundation.](https://osf.io/zgh5u/register/565fb3678c5e4a66b5582f67)
