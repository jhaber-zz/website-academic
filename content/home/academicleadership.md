I’ve organized text data working groups since 2017: I coordinated CTAWG while at UC Berkeley, and I founded and lead GUITAR. In these groups, I’ve arranged speakers, led meetings, presented computational text analysis (CTA) tools and resources, contributed to CTA curriculum and workflows, and designed and coordinated collaborative projects—including analysis of charter school websites, Congressional speeches, and the United Nations General Debates Corpus. I’ve also organized and led special events, including two series of Sociology Job Market Practice Talks, the “Making Text Research-Ready” symposium in Spring 2018, the TextXD (“Text Across Domains”) symposium in 2018 and 2019, and the San Francisco Bay Area’s first Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (Bay-SICSS) in 2020.

In addition to serving on the core organizing committee at TextXD and being a featured speaker, I also worked with the D-Lab to implement cloud infrastructure for the event’s collaborative coding sessions (“hackathons”). In 2018, I led a hands-on tutorial on word embeddings during the pre-symposium CTA bootcamp, using a corpus of ancient Akkadian texts also featured in the next day’s keynote; in 2019, I kicked off the symposium with an introductory tutorial on CTA. I also served as a hackathon data leader, curating and creating a workflow for exploring word embeddings built on my charter schools data. See the code for [my TextXD word embeddings workshop and collaborative session](https://github.com/jhaber-zz/charters4textxd2018). 

I spearheaded Bay-SICSS, building relationships with local non-profit organizations to give participants the opportunity to apply computational skills for social good. Led by our community partners, Bay-SICSS teams studied how disadvantaged groups bore the brunt of the COVID crisis, as shown by changes in food stamp applications, school funding, and online communities. See the [blog post about our successes](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/bay-sicss-bridging-computational-social-scientists-and-practitioners-social-good) and our [post-mortem]( https://msalganik.wordpress.com/2020/08/19/summer-institutes-in-computational-social-science-2020-post-mortem/#Bay-SICSS). I have used community-engaged research in my teaching in similar ways, bridging students with disadvantaged populations through local partner organizations (e.g., Oakland High, urban tutoring programs). Indeed, I often design my courses and data science workshops around hands-on exercises applying scientific methods and reasoning to real-world data and social problems.
