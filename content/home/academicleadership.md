Since Spring 2018, I have coordinated the Computational Text Analysis Working Group (CTAWG): I’ve arranged speakers, led meetings, presented computational text analysis (CTA) tools and resources, contributed to CTA curriculum for the Data-Intensive Social Sciences Laboratory (D-Lab), developed workflows for collaborative coding, and implemented a collaborative project analyzing the United Nations General Debates Corpus. I’ve also led computational workshops at UC Berkeley, including several demos at CTAWG and the Digital Humanities Faire and a guest lecture on web crawling for a graduate CTA course. And I’ve organized and led special events, including two series of Sociology Job Market Practice Talks, the “Making Text Research-Ready” symposium in Spring 2018, and the TextXD (“Text Across Domains”) symposium in December 2018. 

I played several key roles at TextXD. In addition to serving on the core organizing committee and being an event speaker, I also worked with the D-Lab to implement cloud infrastructure for the event’s collaborative coding sessions (“hackathons”). And I led a hands-on tutorial on word embeddings during the pre-symposium CTA bootcamp, using a corpus of ancient Akkadian texts also featured in the next day’s keynote. Finally, I served as a hackathon data leader, curating and creating a workflow for exploring word embeddings built on my charter schools data. For my TextXD word embeddings workshop and collaborative session, see https://github.com/jhaber-zz/charters4textxd2018.
