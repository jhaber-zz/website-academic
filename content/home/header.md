I am a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, expecting to graduate in May 2020. My research applies computational methods to study how organizational contexts shape the impacts of structural inequalities. I analyze the ways organizational identities provide a web of meanings that mediate and reinforce societal inequalities in locally embedded ways.

As someone passionate about data science community and education, I also co-coordinate the D-Labâ€™s Computational Text Analysis Working Group and the TextXD (Text Across Domains) symposium at UC Berkeley as well as the upcoming Summer Institute for Computational Social Science in the San Francisco Bay Area (BAY-SICSS).
