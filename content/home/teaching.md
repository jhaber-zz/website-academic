As someone committed to making computational research methods accessible, Iâ€™ve led data science workshops at UC Berkeley, including several demos at the D-Lab's Computational Text Analysis Working Group and the Digital Humanities Faire and a guest lecture on web crawling for a graduate course in computational social science. Example talk titles include "Introduction to a thorough, practical CTA training" and "Web-scraping at scale: How I captured the corpus of inconsistent charter school websites". I am also experienced in guiding and mentoring undergraduates in computational projects.

As an experienced instructor in sociology, I have three goals for student learning: (1) critical awareness of socially constructed privileges, assumptions, and norms; (2) a sense of connectedness to and compassion for "others"; and (3) accountability for one's contributions both to the learning environment and to the social world. To meet these goals, I use the active learning practices of small group discussion, a rigorous presentation structure, and incremental writing assignments. For my teaching in sociology at UC Berkeley, I received the the Certificate of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education in 2015 and the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award in 2016. As further professional development, I also received a Waldorf Teaching Certificate from the Bay Area Center for Waldorf Teacher Training in 2017.
