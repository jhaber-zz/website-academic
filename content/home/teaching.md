As someone committed to making computational research methods accessible, I’ve led numerous data science workshops at UC Berkeley and Georgetown University (GU). These teaching and learning materials are open-source and free online, including introductions to [computational text analysis (CTA)](https://bit.ly/nlp-repo-2021), [scalable web-crawling](https://bit.ly/repo-crawl-2021), and [text classification with machine learning](https://bit.ly/repo-classify-2021). I’ve also given many demos, including  at the UC Berkeley D-Lab’s Computational Text Analysis Working Group (CTAWG) and the GU Interdisciplinary Text Analysis Research working group (GUITAR), the UC Berkeley Digital Humanities Faire, and guest lectures on CTA and web crawling for graduate and undergraduate courses in computational social science. I am also experienced in guiding and mentoring undergraduates in computational projects, recruiting for diversity by race and gender and supporting new programmers with frequent meetings and feedback.

As a teacher in sociology and education, I have taught as a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) at UC Berkeley for 11 courses in sociology, including twice designing and solo-teaching a course on school choice. My pedagogical vision is that students see clearly the social roots of personal ills and their own ability to make a difference. I aim to instill a sense of proportion about the human stakes of social problems, preparing students to be responsible observers and change-makers. This leads to these goals for student learning: (1) critical awareness of socially constructed privileges, assumptions, and norms; (2) a sense of connectedness to and compassion for “others”; (3) accountability for their contributions to the class and the social world; and (4) respect and openness to all perspectives. 

To meet these learning goals, I use the active learning practices of small group discussion, a rigorous presentation structure, and incremental writing assignments. I balance lecture with activities and discussion to meet multiple learning styles and promote all students’ participation. An example is the “spectrogram” activity: students line themselves up across the room according to their agreement with a claim (e.g., “All students should learn in formal English”). This brings usually quiet voices out through movement, peer support, and my selective “interviews” across the lineup. My pedagogy also adapts to student needs revealed by midterm evaluations, required office hours, and campus situations—such as when I halved the minimum term paper length in response to students struggling to relocate from the dorms during the COVID crisis. For my teaching in sociology at UC Berkeley, I received the Certificate of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education in 2015 and the Outstanding GSI Award in 2016. As further professional development, I also received a Waldorf Teaching Certificate from the Bay Area Center for Waldorf Teacher Training in 2017. In addition, students consistently remark on my enthusiasm, effectiveness in encouraging participation, and the comfortable, open atmosphere of class discussion.
