I investigate an under-examined mechanism for this segregation: Charter schools project identities corresponding to parents’ race- and class-specific parenting styles and educational values. I use computational text analysis to detect the emphasis on inquiry-based learning in the websites of all charter schools operating in the 2015-16 school year. I then estimate mixed linear regression models to test the relationships between ideological emphasis and school- and district-level poverty and ethnicity. I thereby transcend methodological problems in scholarship on charter school identities by collecting contemporary, valid, population-wide data, as well as by blending text analysis with hypothesis testing. Findings suggest that charter school identities are both race- and class-specific, lending weight to arguments for further regulating charter school enrollments. This project contributes to literatures on school choice, educational stratification, and organizational identity.","tags":[],"title":"Sorting Schools: A Computational Analysis of Charter School Identities and Stratification","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jaren Haber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"fbd5ac4f32cbad32e0cabd6ec9361c27","permalink":"www.jarenhaber.com/publication/institutionalized-involvement/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.jarenhaber.com/publication/institutionalized-involvement/","section":"publication","summary":"Is employee involvement universally either good or bad, a “best practice” or an exploitative tool—or do its effects depend on context? To shed light on this issue, I ask the following question: Do organizational–cultural factors determine whether employees are stressed by membership in teams? By constructing mixed-effects models from a large mid-1990s survey of U.S. steel employees, I find that team membership is linked to increased stress only when implemented in cultural contexts of conflict and distrust. I conclude that the unintended consequences of institutionalized formal practices depend on organizationally specific cultural conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Institutionalized Involvement: Teams and Stress in 1990s U.S. Steel","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"47985856194f7e6a897c5f8006f6bb92","permalink":"www.jarenhaber.com/talk/selling-segregation/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.jarenhaber.com/talk/selling-segregation/","section":"talk","summary":"Recent studies have established that there is a strong correlation between charter schools and school segregation. We identify linguistic and psychological mechanisms that tie them together. We scraped mission statements from 5,334 charter school websites across the United States. Computational text analysis of these mission statements describes that the languages used in these schools significantly vary by race (white/black) and poverty. Online experiments support the theory that racially coded linguistic cues influence how viewers perceive racial demographics and valuations of different schools. The findings have implications for educational inequality in general and school segregation in particular. The methods we use also illustrate how the combination of natural language processing and online experiments strengthens both internal and external validity.","tags":[],"title":"Selling Segregation: How Charter School Websites Signal Race and Class--and Parents Listen, joint with Nick Camp and Jae Yeon Kim","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"See my talk on an early version of this method and our developing code on this method.\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"ef1cab0495b4ed628accaddcb635375f","permalink":"www.jarenhaber.com/talk/dictionaries/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"www.jarenhaber.com/talk/dictionaries/","section":"talk","summary":"We develop an general-use, inductive method of generating domain-specific dictionaries through word embedding models. Our workflow has three steps: construct (query model with seed terms to develop core dictionaries), refine (maximize dictionary coherence and distinctiveness), and validate (using unsupervised clustering and hand coding). We are optimizing our approach by varying the core dictionary size, WEM generation method (pre-trained vs. native), and dictionary application method (count-based vs. vector projection). We also compare results from two test cases: charter school websites and a corpus of academic journal articles. Our method of creating and validating new and even complex dictionaries allows researchers in diverse domains an accessible, reproducible, and valid workflow for analyzing researcher-generated themes in texts. This represents a significant improvement on the idiosyncratic, domain-restrictive approach to dictionaries used by social scientists for decades.","tags":[],"title":"Toward Computational Literature Review: Refining Expert-Built Dictionaries for Automated Analysis of Academic Texts, joint with Heather Haveman","type":"talk"}]
